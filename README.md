This is the presentation I gave at the Colorado Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Fall Summit Event on 11/8/2018

Presentation Abstract:

Encryption is a fundamental concept represented prominently in the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Security Guidance, their Cloud Control Matrix (CCM) and the Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ).  Cloud customers must preserve the confidentiality of their data when it is outside their physical control within a cloud service providerâ€™s infrastructure.  Encryption gives the customer control over the data and only authorized systems and applications and users with the key can access the information.

This presentation covers the concepts and provides actual demonstration of using encryption to secure data in transit, at rest, and in use within the Amazon Web Services Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud environment.  Topics covered in this presentation and live demonstration will be: encryption with Simple Storage Service (S3), encryption of Elastic Block Storage (EBS), Key Management Service (KMS), Relational Database Service (RDS) encryption, AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and encrypted web services using HTTPS/TLS, and secure management access.
